Document Analysis:
The website will consist of several different pages that provide different analysis tools
Main page will allow the user to load up to 4 different documents for analysis, as well to select preloaded documents to run analysis on (in this way they can compare their work vs others or subsequent drafts
Page 1: Word Cloud. Creates words clouds of the various documents (assuming we can find the code for this somewhere)
Page 2: General Metrics. Word count, word search, number of sentences, number of questions etc
Page 3: Phrase Tree, Search a word and generate a tree of all words that follow, and running recursively on any word that follows until all sentences have been produced (likewise expect that we can find the code for this somewhere, otherwise I feel like we can code this without too much trouble)
